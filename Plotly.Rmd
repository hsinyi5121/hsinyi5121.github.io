Focus on NYC Airbnb data

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |>  
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) |> 
  select(borough = neighbourhood_group, 
    neighbourhood, stars, price, room_type, lat, long) |> 
  drop_na(stars) |> 
  filter(
    borough == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in%  100:500)
```


Let's make a scatterplot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", stars)) |>  
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5)
```


Let's make a box plot!

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) |>  
  plot_ly(y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```


Let's make a bar plot!

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |>  
  count(neighbourhood) |> 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) |> 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
```


# ggploty

ggplot scatterplot

```{r}
scatter_ggplot = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, color = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  coord_cartesian()

ggplotly(scatter_ggplot)
```
